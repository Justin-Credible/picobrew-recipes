Moderate maltiness with our own Roy's Calais Flint Corn to lighten body and the addition of molasses as the most-available sweetener of the day. If you are starting with Field Corn (which is NOT the grocery store sweet corn), you will need to heat the cracked corn to above 180F in water or wetted in a sous vide bag for 90 minutes or so to release the starches. The corn should be cracked, flaked, or rolled to increase surface area.\nSince I'm attempting to make this with local ingredients, I chose Fuggle Hops as they as similar to East Kent Golding, which was starting be become available in Franklin's time. The \"Oak-Smoked Pale\" here is homemade 2-Row American smoked over both applewood and birch bark. It is intended to mimic the fact that most malts were kiln-dried over fires in Colonial times. Most ales of that era would have been aged in barrels before consumption. \nFor \"Molasses\" I blended 1/3 Mother's Molasses with 1/3 Maple Syrup and 1/3 Balsamico Vinegar. I had aged the Maple-Balsamico in oak for 3 years. I also added 1/3 cup of this mixture to the finished wort when pitching the yeast.
