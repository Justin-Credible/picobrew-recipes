bin. The instructions that came with the kit tell you to put the hops in the first bin.  if you are not paying attention to the recipe you may not spread the hops out over the three bins and the times will be long for some of the hops which will change the composition of the beer. You will be missing some hop flavors adn aroma. Whatever the reason my batch was plenty hoppy for the style (it is not an IPA). It has been the fastest batch to disappear so far. Will need to make another batch soon.","Username":"Slug450"},{"Date":"7/25/2015","Content":"I have made this five times --- all but one were excellent -- bad one due to not knowing how to properly clean the entire Zymatic --- since then every brew has been excellent -- BTW --- pre-warming the water really speedsup as does cooling with a chiller --- cuts cycle to 3.5 hours start to finish","Username":"wrfcdg"},{"Date":"10/21/2015","Content":"My first batch as was probably all of us. This came out beautifully, drinking crew thought I bought it at a store. Not an IPA don't expect full bitterness and hop aroma. Nice easy drinker where the alcohol can sneak up on you it is so well balanced ","Username":"brianil"},{"Date":"12/16/2016","Content":"Had this on the pico and zymatic. both were great.  definitely can taste the difference though.  water chemistry :)","Username":"TheBeerMeistro"},{"Date":"10/12/2016","Content":"I thought this was a great example of a traditional pale ale. The beer had a nice balance of malt and hops. The low finishing gravity makes it an easy drinking beer. I ended up dry hopping it with 2oz of Simcoe hops to give it a more intense hop flavor. ","Username":"dkoerner"},{"Date":"4/11/2017","Content":"Was a very good beer and I enjoyed drinking it. It just was not a great beer, and not all are. Might have been because it was the first beer run through the machine. A yeast upgrade would definetly have help a lot. Think the Wyeast 1056 would have made a big difference in this recipe.","Username":"Pettij"},{"Date":"9/20/2017","Content":"Good hops, nice color, and a good flavor for a hopped pale ale. Took to a small party and it disappeared before the other beers.  ","Username":"jwnmiles"},{"Date":"7/12/2017","Content":"This was a pretty good pale ale in general but there are a few things that need to be improved or modified.  A lot of people are mentioning a lack of hop flavor, I disagree with this, there is enough hop flavor for a pale ale but there is a solid background note of caramel and grain from the grist that may be preventing the hop flavor from really shinning through.  One change that you absolutely need to do is a dry hopping addition to this beer.  It seems to have become a standard that most pale ales are dry hopped and this recipe needs that punch of hop aroma.  I added 1 ounce of Comet that I happened to have available for aroma.  This also increase the perception of bitterness because of how our brain works.  It's actually shocking that Pico's \"flagship\" pale ale doesn't have a dry hop addition.  ","Username":"CLDaigle"},{"Date":"1/23/2018","Content":"if This is the only beer you drink this morning or your looking for a good lawnmower brew then this is it. Has just enough hops to stand out and let you know they’re there but not overwhelming by any means. Good breakfast brew","Username":"Calvin"}]},"OwnedByUser":false,"OwnedByPicoBrew":false,"CanAccess":true,"IsAdmin":false,"AdminView":false,"RedirectURL":null,"PicoBrew_ProfileID":0,"User_ProfileID":0,"UserRated":false,"UserCommented":false,"UserRating":null,"CompartmentNames":{"adjunct":{"0":"Pass Through","2":"Adjunct 1","3":"Adjunct 2","4":"Adjunct 3","5":"Adjunct 4"},"step":{"0":"Pass Through","2":"Adjunct 1","3":"Adjunct 2","4":"Adjunct 3","5":"Adjunct 4","1":"Mash","6":"Pause"}}}}
