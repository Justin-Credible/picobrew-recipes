to the original.  I made two batches(5 gal total), and dry hopped with 3oz of Citra, then transferred to keg, chilled, added gelatin to clear, and waited a week or two, and its turned out fantastic.  Will be brewing it again very soon...","Username":"bleys21"},{"Date":"10/31/2015","Content":"I used the original recipe in the library except I used a Whirlpool for 45 mins at 185 after a 60 minute boil and I used a West Coast Ale yeast by Omega. I fermented right at 63F, transferred to a keg, dryhopped, cooled to 33F, added a little Biofine Clear, and a day later transferred it to a serving keg. Forced carbonated and bottled a week later.\r\nMy initial thoughts are it's a bit bitter, but after a few drinks it becomes more appealing. It has good hop flavor and aroma and is a pretty clean beer. The all Citra hop beer is easy drinking with a great mouth feel.\r\nI will have a 6 pack of 3 Floyd's Zombie Dust soon so I'll be able to compare, but I'm really liking this beer regardless if its a attempt at a clone. From what I remember the real thing had a lot more citrus notes with less bitterness.\r\nThings to improve on: I need to dial in my water chemistry. I added a few things to my RO water, but I'm flying by the seat of my pants. I don't think I'm far off though. The clarity of the beer also needs to be improved. Adding of Whirlfloc and a better mixing of the Biofine clear should do it. I think I may skip the whirlpool step or reduce the amount of 60 minute boil hops I add to reduce the bitterness. I also need to get better at taking gravity readings.\r\nOverall its a success. A very drinkable IPA that you want to continue drinking after one is gone.","Username":"KirkMN"},{"Date":"11/17/2015","Content":"Delicious!  If you like citra, and a citrusy juicy brew, this is for you. Mine came out perfect. In fermenter for 21 days, last 4 days dry hopped. Cold crashed 2 days then transferred to serving keg, added gelatin, and carbed 7 days at 10psi.  Perfect.  Good recipe Sam.","Username":"dukecola"}]},"OwnedByUser":false,"OwnedByPicoBrew":false,"CanAccess":true,"IsAdmin":false,"AdminView":false,"RedirectURL":null,"PicoBrew_ProfileID":0,"User_ProfileID":0,"UserRated":false,"UserCommented":false,"UserRating":null,"CompartmentNames":{"adjunct":{"0":"Pass Through","2":"Adjunct 1","3":"Adjunct 2","4":"Adjunct 3","5":"Adjunct 4"},"step":{"0":"Pass Through","2":"Adjunct 1","3":"Adjunct 2","4":"Adjunct 3","5":"Adjunct 4","1":"Mash","6":"Pause"}}}}
