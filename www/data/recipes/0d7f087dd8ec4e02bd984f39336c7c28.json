Ended up subbing in extra Citra for some of the other hops due to local availability.  So juicy and floral.  \r\n\r\nI also programmed the three whirlpool stages into the PicoBrew with the editor, which was interesting to dig into on my second ever batch.  ","Username":"Cubby96"},{"Date":"8/26/2017","Content":"I see why it's called \"Juicy Bits\".  It really is juicy tasting.  I ended up letting it ferment 1 extra day because of a scheduling conflict, but the beer tastes very, very good.  Aroma is soooo nice.  Very hoppy.  The flavor is a hoppy, fruity taste.  I followed the directions to a T except for that extra day fermenting and that I transferred via siphon.  I recommend this.","Username":"sacincbrew"}]},"OwnedByUser":false,"OwnedByPicoBrew":false,"CanAccess":true,"IsAdmin":false,"AdminView":false,"RedirectURL":null,"PicoBrew_ProfileID":0,"User_ProfileID":0,"UserRated":false,"UserCommented":false,"UserRating":null,"CompartmentNames":{"adjunct":{"0":"Pass Through","2":"Adjunct 1","3":"Adjunct 2","4":"Adjunct 3","5":"Adjunct 4"},"step":{"0":"Pass Through","2":"Adjunct 1","3":"Adjunct 2","4":"Adjunct 3","5":"Adjunct 4","1":"Mash","6":"Pause"}}}}
