These are not included in the recipe crafter.  \n\n***Hop Stand****\n-Once boil is complete, chill to 160-170, pause chilling and add 1oz each of Citra, El Dorado, and Mosaic\n-Allow hops to stand for about 20 minutes, then resume chilling to pitching temp (leave hops in wort, can remove prior to pitching yeast if using hop sock)\n\n***Dry Hop***\n-Make all efforts to eliminate cold side oxidation for NEIPAs (see Brulosophy exBEERiment article below)\n-When gravity reaches approx 1.020 add 2oz each of Citra, Mosaic, and El Dorado as a dry hop\n-Gradually raise the temperature to 71-73 over 3 days to encourage full yeast attenuation\n-Due to schedule issues I let it gradually fall back to 67 for an additional 4 days prior to transferring to serving keg with no ill effects\n-Once target gravity has been reached transfer from fermenter to serving keg under pressure if possible to further minimize oxidation\n-Enjoy!\n\nhttp://brulosophy.com/2017/09/11/the-impact-of-cold-side-oxidation-on-new-england-ipa-exbeeriment-results/","SyncStatus":true,"H2O":4.28,"RecipeFile":null,"Locked":true,"Shared":true,"OriginalName":"NE
