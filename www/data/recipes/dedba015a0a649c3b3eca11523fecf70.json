If you don't want the extra coffee boost... then put that 2 cups back in at the beginning. The coffee Malt will leave coffee traces.\nAfter the 5 days primary fermentation add 1.25 ounce cocoa nibs in sock. After 10 days move beer and Nibs to the the serving keg for 5 more days adding CO2 for the last 2 days @ about 10psi.\nIf you want coffee pre-brew 2 cups of cold brew coffee (like Sun-tea) 7-8 days into fermentation and hang onto it, add it at the end of the primary. \nThe Belgian chocolate and biscuit grains were Dingmans. \nIf you want the mint option add 10 drops of peppermint extract at the end of primary and let sit for 5-7 days.

Also the oil will impact the head retention, but I think that would happen with fresh mint or extract.","SyncStatus":true,"H2O":3.85,"RecipeFile":null,"Locked":true,"Shared":true,"OriginalName":"temp
