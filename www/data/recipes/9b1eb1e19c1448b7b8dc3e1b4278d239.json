Do not attempt this recipe until you have read all the instructions and can be in town for a few weeks as it requires daily monitoring. This set of instructions is for users who use an ice-bucket or chill overnight**** Use Catfish Hunter 120 if you use a chiller. \nTo load: Take the first three hop additions of Amarillo, Simcoe and Warrior - weigh them out, divide into two piles and put them into cages one and two. \nWeigh out the remaining hops, divide into two piles and put them in cages three and four. \nLoad your grains but not the sugars. Those should be hydrated with some warm water in a pitcher or some vessel and added during the boil. Feed the sugar solution in a little at a time over the course of 10 minutes about 10 minutes into the boil. \nWhen the brew cycle completes and the step filter drains and the alarm sounds, silence it. Continue with your regular chilling method in the ice-bucket or simply detach the keg and set some where cool to chill overnight. \nPitch TWO packages of properly hydrated Fermentis S-04 English ale yeast into the cooled wort. \nOn day 5 or 6 pitch two tubes of WLP099 - Super High Gravity ale yeast following the instructions, at this time add 8 ounces of the dextrose (corn sugar) in the morning - simply hydrate this with a little room temperature sterile water. Please use small bottles of water - and just enough to hydrate the sugar. In the evening, add another 8 ounces. Repeat this process over the course of 3 days.  4 lbs total.\nAt the end of this feeding, help your beer along and be sure the fermenting temperature is about 68 - anything lower and this fermenting process will take FOREVER. Try not to get above 70F - nobody likes to drink rocket fuel. \nOnce fermentation is complete, rack this beer to a cleaned and sanitized corny keg. If you have problems because of the massive yeast cake at the bottom of the keg, use an Auto-syphon. They are available at your local homebrew shop or get one online, they're always a good thing to have on hand.\nSo, rack the beer and dry hop with 1oz of Simcoe and 1oz of Amarillo - make sure these are in a hop sock. Dry hop your beer with a silicone lid and airlock, not the metal keg lid. After 7 days, do one more round of dry hopping of 1oz of Simcoe and 1oz of Amarillo. Go ahead and just put this new hop sock in, it's fine to leave the other in. \nAt the end of dry hopping, transfer one last time to your cleaned and sanitized corny keg. Gas it up - it needs bubbles. \nIt will mellow over the course of a month or months.... enjoy your 15% ABV + Hop Bomb! Pour it on pancakes.... \n\nCheers!","SyncStatus":false,"H2O":3.93,"RecipeFile":null,"Locked":true,"Shared":true,"OriginalName":"Catfish Hunter120 NC","OriginalAuthor":"PicoBrew Inc","TastingNotes":"Imperial IPA inspired by Dogfish Head 120 Minute.
