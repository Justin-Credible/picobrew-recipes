# PicoBrew Public Recipe Library Mirror

This is a mirror of the PicoBrew Public Recipe library:

https://www.picobrew.com/PublicRecipes/PublicRecipes

which is available here:

https://pbrecipes.beer/


## Why?

Earlier this year PicoBrew essentially shut down. You can read more details here: https://www.pbfundingllc.com/news

They've been able to keep the servers online so people can finish brewing their PicoPaks, but we're not sure how much longer that will be the case.

The community has been keeping these machines running via a custom server which can run on the Raspberry Pi: https://github.com/chiefwigms/picobrew_pico

This allows people to brew their own custom recipes without the need for the official servers to be online.

As more people get into brewing custom recipes, I thought it would be helpful to have a mirror of the public recipe list in case it also disappears.

This mirror contains only the recipes by the author "PicoBrew Inc." and none of the community submitted recipes.
