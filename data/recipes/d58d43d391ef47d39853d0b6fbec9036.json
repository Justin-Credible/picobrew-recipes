Perhaps I should have cold conditioned it prior to kegging, but I wrote this beer off after about 4 weeks in the keg.  I went back to it two weeks later since I needed to either drink it or dump it to make room for another batch, and it had morphed into a phenomenal beer.  One of the best beers I've brewed to date...after maturing.  -MSumme 4/24/20","Username":"Msumme"},{"Date":"2/23/2018","Content":"Anchor is kinda my (somewhat) local goto in San Jose. I thought this recipe was pretty good, but definitely recommend a little patience to let it cold conditioning - you will be rewarded. At first i was not impressed, but waited an extra weeks and now it is wonderful. Makes me realize how underrated Northern Brewer hops are in these hopped up times. I was also mixing up Black'n'steam (with Denny's VIP) - yummy!\r\nLast year my local grocery had a special dry hopped edition of Anchor Steam, which I will try next time I brew this.","Username":"jtardie"}]},"OwnedByUser":false,"OwnedByPicoBrew":false,"CanAccess":true,"IsAdmin":false,"AdminView":false,"RedirectURL":null,"PicoBrew_ProfileID":0,"User_ProfileID":0,"UserRated":false,"UserCommented":false,"UserRating":null,"CompartmentNames":{"adjunct":{"0":"Pass Through","2":"Adjunct 1","3":"Adjunct 2","4":"Adjunct 3","5":"Adjunct 4"},"step":{"0":"Pass Through","2":"Adjunct 1","3":"Adjunct 2","4":"Adjunct 3","5":"Adjunct 4","1":"Mash","6":"Pause"}}}}
