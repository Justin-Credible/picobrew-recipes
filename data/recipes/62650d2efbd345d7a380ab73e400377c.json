Had overflow/leakage issues and submitted a trouble ticket to Picobrew.  Chilled in Igloo cooler using 53 degree tap water until temp hit 100 degrees.  Then did sequential ice additions to get temp down to 65.  Chilling took ~40 minutes but the period where the Zymatic attempted to simply circulate the wort to ensure a consistent temp was confusing.  The temp kept dropping, but when we then drained the ice water it went back up again.  Ultimately had to chill the keg for another 20 minutes or so with no connection to the Zymatic.  At about 30 minutes into the chilling process major foam started coming out of the foam trap.  Tilting the keg so that the return flow was running down the inside of the keg seemed to help.  Consider tilting keg for entire chill cycle in the future.  Hit the O.G. of 1.062 or perhaps a bit higher.  Dry hop with 1 oz. of Citra that I had left from a previous brew.","SyncStatus":true,"H2O":3.71,"RecipeFile":null,"Locked":true,"Shared":true,"OriginalName":"Pico Pale Ale","OriginalAuthor":"PicoBrew
