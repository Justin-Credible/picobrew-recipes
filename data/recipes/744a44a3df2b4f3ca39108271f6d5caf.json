The banana comes thru in the nose and palate.  My wife has already said I need to make it again.

This turned out perfect and super light and refreshing. Not over powering sweetness from the banana, but was present and welcome.  Delicious! ","Username":"BurningFallsBrewery"},{"Date":"8/16/2019","Content":"Pitched at 65, bumped to 68 after 24 hours, and then 70 after that. Fermented for about a week before hitting FG. Overall, lots of banana esters. Has a little bitterness. Light color, very cloudy. And probably lighter of a mouthfeel than expected.","Username":"mmcconnell"}]},"OwnedByUser":false,"OwnedByPicoBrew":false,"CanAccess":true,"IsAdmin":false,"AdminView":false,"RedirectURL":null,"PicoBrew_ProfileID":0,"User_ProfileID":0,"UserRated":false,"UserCommented":false,"UserRating":null,"CompartmentNames":{"adjunct":{"0":"Pass Through","2":"Adjunct 1","3":"Adjunct 2","4":"Adjunct 3","5":"Adjunct 4"},"step":{"0":"Pass Through","2":"Adjunct 1","3":"Adjunct 2","4":"Adjunct 3","5":"Adjunct 4","1":"Mash","6":"Pause"}}}}
