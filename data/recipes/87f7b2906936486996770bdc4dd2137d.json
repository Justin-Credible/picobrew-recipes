This will improve if you leave in primary for 3 weeks or more, and/or bottle/keg condition for a few weeks or more.  This is a simple and refreshing spring and summer beer that will be a hit at parties in the backyard.\n\nThis is also a fun beer to improvise with: try an alternative yeast (WLP862 \"Cry Havoc\" at 52F or 59F, or Safbrew S-33 at 62F, or Safale S-04 at 68); add or subtract the flaked corn; add grain for a deeper colour; increase the second hop addition to 0.25 ounces; add cascade hops at \"burnout\" for aroma; and just test it over time to see increase clarity and to let it mellow.","SyncStatus":false,"H2O":3.0,"RecipeFile":null,"Locked":true,"Shared":true,"OriginalName":"Spotted Cow
