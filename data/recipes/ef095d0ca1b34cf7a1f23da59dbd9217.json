For my dry hop I used pellets for everything except Amarillo, which was leaf.  \r\nI think this is my new go-to IPA, and I think it's even better than Shiny the Welder (and definitely more sessionable).  Compared to the Shiny recipe, this is more tropical.  Pores a beautiful pale orange colour.  It's dry and bursting with hop flavor and aroma, a truly amazing example of how to use hops. I think the 6% ABV helps highlight the hops.  Definitely has a full body.  Lots of hops here: citrus (grapefruit tangerine combo/orange peel, maybe a little bit of mango, with grapefruit aroma at pore), pine, fruity notes, and some floral notes.  Has a nice dry, bitter finish.  Crisp. Makes me want another one right away.  A truly excellent IPA.  Love it.\r\n","Username":"mark"},{"Date":"9/5/2015","Content":"Awesome beer !","Username":"DavidB"},{"Date":"3/10/2018","Content":"Have been using this as base for my IPS's for 2 years; changing the hops and experimenting with great success. Try replacing Chinook with Eukaknot, or the SImco with HBC342 or Denali for a change.... \r\n\r\nThanks Annie for a great starter.","Username":"OwenM"},{"Date":"10/29/2015","Content":"I substituted mosaic for amarillo in the dry hopping and it worked out well.  If I were to brew again, I would increase the dry hopping by about an ounce combined.  The aroma seemed a little underwhelming.  The bitterness is a little high, so next time I plan to whirlpool for 45min at 180 and decrease the bittering addition by 1/4oz to let the late additions do some bittering.  The beer hit all the numbers and clarity was good.  It was a good IPA, but I think I can push it to be better.
